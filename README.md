# Task 3 â€“ Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology**.  
The objective is to **train and visualize a Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service, based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source:** [Bank Marketing Dataset â€“ OpenML](https://www.openml.org/d/1461)
- **Description:** The dataset contains marketing campaign data from a Portuguese banking institution.
- **Target variable (`y`):** Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (Yes/No).

## ðŸ§© Project Workflow

### ðŸ”¹ Block 1 â€“ Load & Inspect Data

- Loaded dataset using `fetch_openml`
- Printed dataset shape and previewed first few rows

### ðŸ”¹ Block 2 â€“ Preprocessing

- Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`
- Split dataset into **training** and **testing** sets

### ðŸ”¹ Block 3 â€“ Train Classifier

- Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** without depth limit
- Checked model complexity (depth, number of leaves)

### ðŸ”¹ Block 4 â€“ Full Tree Visualization

- Generated and saved the **entire decision tree** as a **high-resolution PDF**
- Reason: full tree is too large to display inline, PDF ensures better readability

## ðŸš€ Key Learnings

- Handling categorical data with encoders is essential for ML models
- Decision Trees are interpretable but can grow very complex
- Proper visualization techniques are crucial to analyze model decisions
